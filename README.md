## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises



## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named 
[exercise_number_answer].txt.

For example, if in one of the exercise repos question 13 just asked a question to explain a programming concept, store your answer inside of a new file named exercise_13_answer.txt.

## Testing / Verification

Include relevant details here about where solution files are stored
